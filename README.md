devenv
======

This is my cross-platform development enviroment intial setup config files.

Simply git clone it at your $HOME folder
Eg: git clone <url> . 

As of now this works on, 

Windows(with cygwin)
Mac OSx
Linux 

Note: For Windows I like setting C:\cygwin_home as %HOME% enviroment variable, to keep the configs away from binary.
